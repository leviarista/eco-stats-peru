                                The Red de Arboles Foundation was born in 2015 after the desire to support the conservation of our ecosystems and contribute to reducing the environmental impact that is generated every day.<br />
                                The sole purpose of this foundation is to plant trees in areas affected by human activities and natural disasters. <br />
                                They have planted more than 50,000 native trees in different places in Perú, such as Medellín, Cali, Mosquera, Cota and Bogotá.
